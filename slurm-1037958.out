Jupyter server is running on: gpu-10
Job starts at: Sat May  4 15:53:26 EDT 2019

Step 1 :

If you are working in NYU campus, please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 6891:localhost:6891 tx506@prince.hpc.nyu.edu

If you are working off campus, you should already have ssh tunneling setup through HPC bastion host, 
that you can directly login to prince with command

ssh tx506@prince

Please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 6891:localhost:6891 tx506@prince

Step 2:

Keep the iTerm windows in the previouse step open. Now open browser, find the line with

The Jupyter Notebook is running at: gpu-10

the URL is something: http://localhost:6891/?token=XXXXXXXX (see your token below)

you should be able to connect to jupyter notebook running remotly on prince compute node with above url
